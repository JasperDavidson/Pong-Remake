# Pong-Remake
I remade pong using the python library for making games, pygame.

The game will automatically end when one player reaches five points.

There are four skins to choose from, including the default.

Move the left pong with w and s; move the right pong with the up arrow and down arrow.

I'm currently working on making it possible to play against a computer.
