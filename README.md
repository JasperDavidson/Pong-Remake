# Pong-Remake
I remade pong using the python library for making games, pygame.

The game will automatically end when one player reaches five points.

There are four skins to choose from, including the default.

Move the left pong with w and s; move the right pong with the up arrow and down arrow.

There is a also a powerup mode with three powerups currently: Slow, which slows the player down in the x and y direction; Speed, which speeds the player up in the x and y direction; and Expand, which expands the paddle of whoever hit the ball last.
